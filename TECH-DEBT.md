## Active bundles (investigation → plan → apply)

Remaining work is grouped into four substantive bundles. Each bundle
runs in three phases — **investigate** (research the surface area
without touching code), **plan** (decide the concrete sequence), then
**apply** (one or more PRs). Order is intentional: foundational tokens
first, then the last `/skills` quality gap, then a real feature, then
the framework cutover.

| #   | Bundle                | Items          | Phase | Notes                                                      |
| --- | --------------------- | -------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Style-system overhaul | T16 + T10      | done  | Token sweep across `constants.js` + every CSS callsite     |
| 2   | `/skills` quality     | T5 + T11 + C13 | done  | Perf investigation + visual-gate decision + README refresh |
| 3   | Contact + CF infra    | U6 + T12       | done  | Pages Function + KV bindings                               |
| 4   | Framework future      | T9             | done  | React Router v7 migration + CF Pages → Workers cutover     |

All four bundles are shipped. The tracker is effectively closed — remaining
UI ideas (U10–U24) are **parked** under a decision noted below; the last
open technical item (C10) landed with the same PR that added this note.

### Bundle 1 — Style-system overhaul (T16 + T10)

**Why bundle.** Both touch [app/styles/constants.js](app/styles/constants.js) and every CSS callsite. Sequencing them in one workstream means tokens get sweep-edited once instead of twice.

- **Investigate — DONE.** `var(--token)` cannot be used inside `@media`
  queries. The MQL5 grammar (`<mf-value> = <number> | <dimension> |
<ident> | <ratio>`) admits no function tokens, and custom properties
  resolve per-element at computed-value time — there's no element
  context for `@media` evaluation. MDN states it directly: _"Variables
  do not work inside media queries and container queries"_ ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)).
  Confirmed unsupported in every mainstream browser; this is
  spec-level, not a vendor gap. Workaround options:
  - Stay on a preprocessor (postcss-simple-vars, Sass) for media-query
    tokens — build-time substitution, works everywhere.
  - `@custom-media` rule (MQL5 working draft Feb 2026) via
    `postcss-custom-media` — native support is essentially 0% in 2026,
    so this is still build-time anyway, just with different syntax.
  - JS-emitted token generators (Style Dictionary, etc.) — overkill
    for ~5 breakpoints.

  **Decision: keep `postcss-simple-vars` for breakpoint tokens only;
  migrate every other token to CSS custom properties.** This unifies
  the system with the existing `:root { --bg-*, --fg-*, --accent }`
  setup that already powers dark/light theming in [app/styles/style.css](app/styles/style.css)
  — there's already a CSS-custom-property layer there, we're just
  rolling the rest of the tokens into it. Breakpoints stay on
  simple-vars (which is what they already use today) so we don't have
  to invent a separate mechanism just for `@media`.

- **Plan.**
  1. **T16 first.** Migration plan is already written (see [T16
     entry](#t16--standardise-breakpoints-legacy--tailwind-aligned-scale-p1--done));
     remaps 17 legacy `$mobile-small`/`$desktop-small`/`$desktop-medium`
     callsites to `$bp-sm`/`$bp-md`/`$bp-lg`/`$bp-xl`/`$bp-2xl`. No
     other token changes in that PR — keeps the diff reviewable and
     the visual-baseline regen scope bounded to layout shifts at the
     new breakpoint boundaries.
  2. **T10 second.** Sweep every non-breakpoint token in
     [constants.js](app/styles/constants.js) (~50 colour/spacing/border/
     radius/typography/shadow entries) into `:root` custom properties.
     Keep the JSON-keyed export only for the breakpoint subset that
     simple-vars consumes. Drop the simple-vars `unknown` callback for
     non-breakpoint tokens — `var(--foo)` typos read as inherited
     `unset` rather than a build warning, so we'll need stylelint's
     `declaration-property-value-no-unknown` (now re-enableable) +
     potentially `stylelint-use-defined-vars` or a small custom check
     to keep the typo-catcher coverage. T10 likely splits into 2 PRs
     by category (palette + theme first, then spacing/typography/
     borders) to keep visual-baseline regen scoped.
- **Apply.** T16 PR (visual baseline regen) → T10a PR (colour + theme
  tokens) → T10b PR (spacing + typography + borders + shadows). Final
  PR re-enables stylelint's `declaration-property-value-no-unknown`,
  `shorthand-property-no-redundant-values`, `color-function-alias-notation`
  per the §6 note in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Bundle 2 — `/skills` quality (T5 + T11 + C13)

**Why bundle.** T5 + T11 are the last open items about `/skills`'s end-user experience (one perf, one visual-regression coverage). Investigating together avoids relearning the route's render path twice. C13 (README refresh) rides along because the perf investigation touches the Lighthouse narrative the README already cites.

- **Investigate — DONE.** Mined the per-merge `lighthouse/skills-index-*.summary.json` files instead of a fresh WebPageTest run; we have 20+ data points across recent commits and the pattern is clear.

  **T5 perf (current state):**
  - The T5 entry claims 0.87 baseline with LCP 3.5s / FCP 2.5s. **Stale.** Across the last ~20 merges to main, `/skills` index has scored Performance **0.94–0.98** on Lighthouse mobile (Lantern simulator), with median **FCP 1.5s / LCP 2.4s**. The d93e747 run that prompted this investigation (0.93, FCP 2.3s, LCP 2.7s) sits on the noisy end of the band, not the median.
  - TBT 0ms · CLS 0 · TTFB 79ms · Speed Index 2.3s — all excellent. **JS payload and edge latency are not bottlenecks.**
  - The 4 failing audits on `/skills` are all critical-path shape, not weight: `render-blocking-insight` (0), `network-dependency-tree-insight` (0), `unused-javascript` (0), `cache-insight` (0.5).
  - Roboto IS preloaded at root level (rides every route). Monaspace IS preloaded on `/skills`. The route stylesheet is 20.78 KB raw / 3.66 KB gzip — small.
  - **Verdict:** T5's 0.95 target is essentially met. Whatever marginal gain remains is in critical-path shape (fewer chained requests, smaller render-blocking CSS for FCP), not in any single big win. Marking T5 as a wider scope than warranted; **dropping the entry to a smaller follow-up**.

  **T11 visual gate (was the premise still true?):**
  - The exclusion list in [visual.spec.ts](tests/e2e/visual.spec.ts) covers _three_ routes, for **two different reasons**:
    1. `/skills/:uuid` + `/education` index — local Docker regen captures a `useLocation()` hydration overlay instead of the page. **T7's CI-side regen workflow solves this** (the race only fires in the local Docker env, not on the GitHub runner — we just used it on T16 for the breakpoint baselines and again on T10b for the equal-height card change). These two routes can be re-added.
    2. `/skills` index — separate problem. The tenure-heatmap renders ~30 SVG cells × ~10 years, anti-aliased per pixel. The grid drifts ~0.4% across regen environments invisible to the eye but consistently above the 0.2% diff budget. **A different visual-regression tool wouldn't escape this** — Percy/Chromatic also pixel-diff SVG. The only fixes are (a) masking the chart entirely (defeats the gate's point for that route) or (b) raising `maxDiffPixelRatio` to ~0.005 (gate becomes useless for content shifts).
  - **Verdict on T11:** dissolve. Re-add `/skills/:uuid` + `/education` index to ROUTES (via T7's workflow for the baselines); keep `/skills` index out with the now-clarified rationale (SVG anti-aliasing, not hydration race, not tool-fixable). **No paid service needed.**

- **Plan.**
  1. **C13 README refresh + visual-baseline how-to** (own PR, doc-only). Sweeps the ~20 PRs of drift documented in the C13 entry and adds a "Visual baselines" section covering both flows (`npm run test:visual:update` locally vs `regen-baselines.yml` on CI). Lands first because it's reviewable independent of code changes.
  2. **T5 + T11 in one PR**:
     - Re-add `/skills/:uuid` + `/education` index to the visual-spec ROUTES list. Dispatch `regen-baselines.yml` for fresh PNGs (those two routes never had committed baselines because the local regen kept failing).
     - Update the in-file exclusion comment in `visual.spec.ts` so future readers understand `/skills` index stays out for a different reason than the others.
     - Flip T5 + T11 to `done` in TECH-DEBT, with the updated rationale captured in the long-form entries. No code change in the perf direction — the data shows we're already at target.

- **Apply.** C13 first (doc-only, fast review). Then T5+T11 combined PR. C13 lands the bundle table flip; T5+T11 closes it out.

### Bundle 3 — Contact + CF infra (U6 + T12)

**Why bundle.** U6 (`/contact`) is what motivates T12 (Cloudflare bindings); they ship together or T12 is just speculative scaffolding.

- **Investigate — DONE.** Four research streams:

  - **Email provider — Resend.** Free tier is 3,000 emails/month with 100/day cap, 1 verified sending domain, 30-day log retention ([resend.com pricing docs](https://resend.com/pricing)). The `resend` npm SDK runs in Pages Functions without `nodejs_compat` — it's fetch-only with guarded `process.env` access; Resend publishes an [official Cloudflare Workers quickstart](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-cloudflare-workers). Bare-`fetch` against `POST https://api.resend.com/emails` is also viable (5-line implementation) if we want to avoid SDK dep-risk. **Loops is the wrong fit:** its free tier is marketing-focused (1,000 contacts cap, "Powered by Loops" footer); transactional sending is paid-plan only. No Cloudflare Workers guide. The Loops API requires pre-created `transactionalId` templates, awkward for a single-form contact endpoint.
  - **Spam protection — honeypot only, no Turnstile (yet).** Honeypot field catches generic form-spam bots with ~5 lines of code, zero deps, zero external calls. Modern LLM-driven scrapers can defeat it but for a CV site with zero existing spam traffic that risk isn't real yet. Turnstile is a fine fallback (free, WCAG 2.2 AA, three modes; siteverify endpoint with 300s single-use tokens) — keep it documented as "add if spam arrives" rather than premature complexity. **Both = marginal gain at the cost of two failure paths.**
  - **Rate limit — per-IP per-hour via KV.** Key: `ratelimit:<sha256(ip)>`, TTL 3600s. Read on POST; if count > 3, return 429. Otherwise increment and continue. KV's eventual consistency is fine for a soft rate limit (~5–60s propagation). Cost: 1 read + 1 write per submission, well under the free-tier limits.
  - **CF Pages Function pattern — no separate function needed.** The catch-all `functions/[[path]].ts` already routes every request through the Remix server build. The `/contact` route's `action` export receives the form `Request` and can read bindings via `context.cloudflare.env.*`. No new function file, just a new route module + a binding declared in `wrangler.toml` + the `worker-configuration.d.ts` regen via `npm run cf-typegen`.

- **Plan.**

  1. **Bindings + secrets** (`wrangler.toml`, `worker-configuration.d.ts`):
     - `RATELIMIT_KV` — KV namespace, per-IP submission counter.
     - `RESEND_API_KEY` — Secret (set via `wrangler secret put` or the Pages dashboard, not committed).
     - `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`, `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` — plain vars (the recipient inbox and the verified sender address on `gonzalo-alvarez-campos-cv.com`).
  2. **Route**: `app/routes/contact.tsx` with:
     - `meta` via `mergeRouteMeta` (title "Contact — Gonzalo Alvarez Campos", description from intl).
     - `loader` returns `{ siteKey: null }` (placeholder for Turnstile if added later); cache via `Vary: Cookie, Accept-Language`.
     - Default export — a `<Form method="post">` with name + email + subject + message fields, an inline `<input type="text" name="website" tabIndex={-1} aria-hidden="true" autoComplete="off">` honeypot, `useNavigation` to surface submitting state, and `useActionData` to render success/error/rate-limited messages. All copy via `react-intl`.
     - `action` parses the form, validates via Zod (`ContactSchema` — required name 2–80 char, email RFC, subject 2–120, message 10–4000), rejects on filled honeypot (silent 200), reads `RATELIMIT_KV` for the client's IP (`request.headers.get('CF-Connecting-IP')`), increments + 429 if over 3/hr, otherwise sends via Resend and returns `{ status: 'ok' }`.
     - Local `ErrorBoundary` mirroring the `/skills/:uuid` shape.
  3. **Intl keys** (~12 new entries in `en-US.json` + `es-ES.json`):
     - `CONTACT_PAGE_TITLE`, `CONTACT_LEAD` (the intro paragraph)
     - `CONTACT_NAME_LABEL`, `CONTACT_EMAIL_LABEL`, `CONTACT_SUBJECT_LABEL`, `CONTACT_MESSAGE_LABEL`
     - `CONTACT_SUBMIT`, `CONTACT_SUBMITTING`
     - `CONTACT_SUCCESS`, `CONTACT_ERROR`, `CONTACT_RATE_LIMITED`
     - `CONTACT_VALIDATION_REQUIRED`, `CONTACT_VALIDATION_EMAIL`, `CONTACT_VALIDATION_LENGTH`
  4. **NavBar entry** in [app/components/NavBar/index.tsx](app/components/NavBar/index.tsx) `MAIN_NAV` — labelled `NAV_CONTACT` (already used elsewhere? check or add), pointing at `/contact`.
  5. **Styling**: per-route stylesheet `app/routes/contact/style.css` (form layout, label/input spacing, error-state borders, success card). Reuses `route-page-title` global.
  6. **Tests**:
     - `tests/e2e/contact.spec.ts` — happy path (form renders, validation surfaces, mocked success state). Don't actually send email in tests.
     - Add `/contact` to a11y route iteration in `tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts`.
     - Add `/contact` to visual ROUTES in `tests/e2e/visual.spec.ts` and regen baselines via the CI workflow.
  7. **Docs**: README "Updating content" gets a brief "Contact form configuration" subsection covering the three env-var/secret values. AGENTS.md §10 (Cloudflare Pages) gets a mention that bindings are now real, not commented templates.

- **Apply.** Single PR is fine — it's all one concern, and reviewing the form code separately from the wiring would be more confusing than less. Sequence inside the PR: bindings + types → route + action → intl keys → NavBar + styles → tests → docs. Closes both U6 and T12.

### Bundle 4 — Framework future (T9) — DONE

**Migrated (2026-07-01).** Site is now on React Router v7 (7.18.x) with Cloudflare Workers + Static Assets, replacing Remix v2 + CF Pages.

The safety-net branch `remix-version-backup` remains on origin at the last known-good Remix v2 SHA. If any regression surfaces post-deploy that isn't fixable forward, the rollback is: flip DNS in the CF dashboard back to the Pages project (Cloudflare keeps both parallel for a while), then `git reset --hard remix-version-backup` on main.

**Migration notes captured for posterity** (record what the runbook didn't cover):

- The codemod's `package.json` output references `@react-router/cloudflare-pages@^7.0.0` — **this package does not exist on npm.** Delete it manually. Also the codemod pins everything at `^7.0.0`; bump to current `^7.18.1`.
- The codemod wraps `Layout`'s JSX return in an outer `(...)`. Syntactically valid, cosmetically weird — Prettier normalises it.
- `flatRoutes()` from `@react-router/fs-routes` scans **every** file in `app/routes/`, including `.css`. Under Remix v2, the shared home-route stylesheet lived at `app/routes/style.css`; under RR v7 that path made the route plugin try to parse the CSS as a route module and crash. **Fix:** moved home route into `app/routes/_index/` (folder) with `index.tsx` + `style.css` inside — the plugin now sees the CSS as a route-adjacent file, not a top-level route candidate.
- `data(payload, { headers })` in a loader **doesn't propagate response headers automatically** in RR v7 the way it did in Remix v2. You have to explicitly export a `headers` function from the route that returns the loader-set headers:

  ```ts
  export function headers({ loaderHeaders }: { loaderHeaders: Headers }) {
    return loaderHeaders;
  }
  ```

  Added to `app/routes/skills._index/index.tsx` so the 1h `Cache-Control` + `Vary: Accept-Language, Cookie` still ship. Any future route that wants edge-cache behaviour needs this export too.

- **Static assets need explicit `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)` delegation from `workers/app.ts`.** With `run_worker_first: true`, every request hits the Worker first — including `/assets/*`, `/fonts/*`, `/favicon.ico`, etc. The RR handler returns 404 for those. Workaround: `workers/app.ts` checks a small allowlist of static-prefix paths and hands them off to `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)` before the RR handler runs. This replaces the Pages `_routes.json` exclusion list.
- **`virtual:react-router/server-build`** is only resolvable inside Vite. `wrangler dev` chokes on it. Use the classic pattern instead: `import * as build from '../build/server'`.
- **`renderToReadableStream` doesn't exist on `react-dom/server` in Node.** The codemod leaves it there — works in Workers (V8) but blows up under `react-router dev` (Vite's Node SSR runtime treats `/server` as CJS-only, and the Node build doesn't export `renderToReadableStream` anyway). Original v7 fix: `import { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server.browser'` + `app/react-dom-server-browser.d.ts` shim. **Superseded by the RR v8 sweep** — the `.browser` subpath's scheduler calls `MessageChannel`, which Cloudflare Workers doesn't expose at our compat date. Current entry uses `react-dom/server.edge` + `app/react-dom-server-edge.d.ts`; see [docs/migrations/rr7-to-rr8.md](docs/migrations/rr7-to-rr8.md).
- **`workers/app.ts`'s `../build/server` import needs eslint-disable for `import/no-unresolved`.** The file only exists after `npm run build`; CI runs lint before build. Locally you might not notice if `build/` is present. Same pattern the old `functions/[[path]].ts` used.
- **Phase C (`Route.LoaderArgs` type migration) was skipped as unnecessary.** The pre-migration plan called for adopting the generated `Route.LoaderArgs` / `Route.ComponentProps` pattern because `useLoaderData<typeof loader>()` "silently lies" under Single Fetch's turbo-stream serialiser (which preserves `Date`/`Map`/`undefined` where JSON-narrowed types don't). Audited our loaders post-migration: none of them return those types in their payloads (Date is used internally to compute numbers; nothing exports Map or undefined). The classic typing is accurate for our codebase. Not worth the mechanical churn or the tsc-`.js`-extension fight in `.react-router/types/`. Re-open if a future loader returns a `Date` object.

**What the investigation surfaced** (record so future-self doesn't relearn it cold):

- **The codemod is a starting point, not a finished migration.** Running `npx codemod remix/2/react-router/upgrade` rewrites imports across the codebase but produces:
  - A `package.json` that references `@react-router/cloudflare-pages` — **this package does not exist on npm.** The codemod's template assumes a Pages adapter that was never published.
  - `functions/[[path]].ts` rewritten to import from the non-existent package — broken.
  - Stale `future:` flags left in `vite.config.ts` even though Single Fetch is the default in v7.
  - `package.json` scripts (`build`, `dev`, `start`, `preview`, `deploy`) not all updated.
  - `overrides.@remix-run/dev` block left in `package.json`.
  - The peer-dep on `react-router-dom@6.30.4` not removed.
- **Cloudflare's official 2026 stance is "RR v7 apps run on Workers, not Pages".** There is no first-party `@react-router/cloudflare-pages` adapter, and the "Pages-via-bridge" path I documented in the original investigation is fragile — the codemod doesn't support it cleanly, so the migration is effectively forced into a Pages → Workers deploy change in the same PR as the framework swap.
- **Scope estimate:** 30–50 files changed in one combined PR (codemod output + manual fixes + `workers/app.ts` + `wrangler.jsonc` + `_headers`/`_routes.json` port + `ci.yml` updates + `load-context.ts` + test-utils + Storybook preview). Multi-hour focused session, not "do it while we chat".

**Original three-PR plan** (kept for reference — actually shipped as a single combined PR + a follow-up docs commit, not the split originally imagined):

1. **PR 1 — Codemod + dep swap.** Run codemod, manually fix the bogus `@react-router/cloudflare-pages` reference, create `app/routes.ts` + `react-router.config.ts`, drop `app/single-fetch.d.ts`, delete the `react-router-dom` pin, drop all `v3_*` future flags. Keep deploying to CF Pages via the transitional bridge.
2. **PR 2 — Cloudflare Workers cutover.** Replace `functions/[[path]].ts` with `workers/app.ts`, port `_headers` + `_routes.json` into `wrangler.jsonc`, set `run_worker_first: true`, smoke-test against a `*.workers.dev` URL **before** flipping the custom-domain DNS. Highest-risk PR.
3. **PR 3 — Type cleanup.** _Dropped_ — the audit showed our loaders don't emit types Single Fetch would preserve differently. See the last bullet under "Migration notes captured for posterity" above.

The single-PR path ended up being cleaner because PRs 1 + 2 turned out to be entangled: the CF Pages bridge the plan assumed (`@react-router/cloudflare-pages`) doesn't exist on npm, so keeping the Pages deploy path alive between PR 1 and PR 2 wasn't actually feasible.

**Investigation findings** (kept verbatim since they're the substantive research output):

- **Investigate — DONE.** Walked the [official RR v7 upgrade guide](https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/remix), Cloudflare's [Workers + React Router framework guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/), and the [CF Pages → Workers migration docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/migration-guides/migrate-from-pages/). Headline findings:

  **The boring parts (mostly automated).**

  - Package renames are handled by `npx codemod remix/2/react-router/upgrade`:
    - `@remix-run/react` → `react-router` (shared APIs — `Link`, hooks, `redirect`, `data`, etc.)
    - `@remix-run/cloudflare` → `@react-router/cloudflare`
    - `@remix-run/dev` → `@react-router/dev`
    - `react-router-dom@6.30.4` devDep → **delete** (v7 collapses the dual-package setup, finally resolving the T15-era pinning workaround)
  - Vite plugin renames: `vitePlugin as remix` → `reactRouter` from `@react-router/dev/vite`. `future:` block disappears entirely. Config moves to a new `react-router.config.ts` (`{ ssr: true }`).
  - **Single Fetch is default in v7** — `v3_singleFetch` flag and `app/single-fetch.d.ts` augmentation can both be deleted with no behaviour change.
  - Flat routes still work — `skills.$uuid/`, `_index.tsx`, `contact._index/` directory conventions all continue to function. Just add an `app/routes.ts` exporting `flatRoutes()` from `@react-router/fs-routes`.
  - `loader`/`action`/`meta` exports unchanged. `LoaderFunctionArgs` etc. move to `react-router`.

  **The real landmine — Cloudflare Pages → Workers cutover.**

  - There is **no first-party `@react-router/cloudflare-pages` adapter**. Cloudflare's official position in 2026 is that React Router v7 apps deploy to **Workers + Static Assets**, not Pages. `@remix-run/cloudflare-pages` has no v7 equivalent.
  - This means the catch-all `functions/[[path]].ts` + `createPagesFunctionHandler` pattern goes away. Replacement: a `workers/app.ts` exporting a `fetch` handler that calls `createRequestHandler` from `@react-router/cloudflare`.
  - `_headers` (1y immutable cache on `/assets/*`) and `_routes.json` (excludes `/data/*` from the Function) translate into `wrangler.jsonc` asset rules + `run_worker_first: true`.
  - The 1h `Cache-Control` on `/skills` and `Vary: Accept-Language, Cookie` segmentation need re-verification on the Workers path — semantics should be identical but worth a manual smoke test against prod.
  - **Bridge option:** `npx wrangler pages functions build` compiles the existing `functions/` folder into a Worker; Cloudflare explicitly documents this as transitional. For a 12-route SSR app it's only useful as a stopgap to keep the dep-rename PR small.

  **Type system upgrade — adjacent, optional, recommended.**

  - `useLoaderData<typeof loader>()` typing **silently degrades** under v7's default Single Fetch — the turbo-stream serialiser preserves `Date`, `Map`, `undefined`, but JSON-narrowed types lie about that. The fix is the new generated-types pattern: `import type { Route } from './+types/<route>'` → `Route.LoaderArgs`, `Route.ComponentProps`. Auto-generated into `.react-router/` (gitignore + add to `tsconfig.include`).
  - Replaces `useLoaderData<typeof loader>()` everywhere. Not a blocker, but the right way to land on v7.

  **Other heads-ups.**

  - `defer()` is deprecated — return Promises directly. We don't use `defer()`, so a non-issue.
  - Visual baselines will likely shift (different hydration script tags, possible `Layout` export pattern changes) — plan one CI regen pass.
  - Storybook 10 supports RR v7's `react-router` package; the preview decorator's `createMemoryRouter` usage stays the same.

- **Plan — three PRs, sequenced.**

  1. **PR 1 — Codemod + dep swap (low risk, biggest auto-changed footprint).** Run `npx codemod remix/2/react-router/upgrade`, manually review the diff, add the new `app/routes.ts` + `react-router.config.ts`, rename Vite plugin, rename entries (`ServerRouter`/`HydratedRouter`), delete `react-router-dom` pin, delete `app/single-fetch.d.ts`, drop all five `v3_*` future flags. **Keep deploying to Cloudflare Pages** via the `wrangler pages functions build` bridge so the deploy path doesn't change in the same PR as the framework swap. Gates green (typecheck, tests, lint, build, e2e behavioural). Visual baselines may need a single regen.
  2. **PR 2 — Cloudflare Workers cutover (highest risk, smallest dep diff).** Replace `functions/[[path]].ts` with `workers/app.ts`, port `_headers` + `_routes.json` into `wrangler.jsonc` asset rules, set `run_worker_first: true`, update `npm run deploy` to `wrangler deploy`, smoke-test the deploy against prod (including the 1h `/skills` cache + locale `Vary`). Lighthouse should be unchanged — same edge, same SSR runtime.
  3. **PR 3 — Type cleanup (low risk, mechanical).** Migrate loaders + components to `Route.LoaderArgs` / `Route.ComponentProps`, drop `LoaderFunctionArgs` imports, regen visual baselines if anything shifts. Closes the migration.

- **Apply.** Three PRs in sequence. Wait for each to merge + go green on prod before opening the next. **PR 2 is the one to be careful about** — if anything breaks the prod deploy it'll be that one, so consider doing it on a weekend and having `wrangler pages deploy` ready as the rollback path while the bridge is still in place.

## 1. Technical

### T1 — a11y test coverage in CI (P0)

`@axe-core/playwright` integration in `tests/e2e/`. Run axe on each route, fail on serious/critical violations. Catches what Lighthouse misses. ~30 lines of spec code + 1 new devDep.

### T2 — Lighthouse gating in CI (P0)

Lighthouse CI runs post-merge today and commits scores under `lighthouse/`. Add a pre-merge run against the preview deploy; fail the PR if Performance < 0.85 mobile. Stops perf regressions before they ship.

### T3 — Stop serving `/data/*` publicly (P0)

`public/_routes.json` excludes `/data/*` from the Pages Function, exposing `skills.json` + `education.json` at `gonzalo-alvarez-campos-cv.com/data/skills.json`. No external consumer today; scrapers can lift the entire CV including draft Spanish copy. Vite bakes the JSON into the server bundle, so we don't need it served. Drop the exclude.

### T4 — `fetchpriority="high"` on company logo (P0)

Likely the LCP element on `/skills/:uuid`. Add `fetchpriority="high"` + `decoding="async"`. One-line change in [app/routes/skills.$uuid/index.tsx](app/routes/skills.$uuid/index.tsx).

### T5 — Recover `/skills` Lighthouse perf (P1) — DONE

The 0.87 baseline was already gone by the time this entry was investigated. Bundle 2's investigation mined the 20+ per-merge `lighthouse/skills-index-*.summary.json` summaries and found median Performance **0.94–0.98**, FCP **1.5s**, LCP **2.4s** — TBT 0, CLS 0, TTFB 79ms. Target (0.95+) is met on most runs. The remaining failing audits are critical-path shape (render-blocking, network dependency tree, unused JS, cache lifetimes) with no single big win available — bumping further would mean shaving milliseconds across each audit, not landing one fix. Closing this entry; if a future regression drops a route below 0.90, file a new perf entry rather than reopening this one.

### T6 — Bundle visualizer audit (P1) — DONE

Ran `npx vite-bundle-visualizer` on a fresh `npm run build`. **Total client JS: 393 KB raw / 127 KB gzip across all routes.** Per-route initial-page cost ≈ 115 KB gzip (components + root + utils + route chunk + entry.client). Findings:

- **`components-BRNNisoL.js` — 253 KB raw / 80 KB gzip.** React + ReactDOM + Remix runtime. The dominant chunk by far; no easy wins without dropping React itself.
- **`utils-BgqF83j_.js` — 76 KB raw / 21 KB gzip.** Mostly `date-fns` (`format`, `formatDuration`, `intervalToDuration`, `differenceInMonths`) + the Spanish locale data. Already using named imports — date-fns v3+ is fully tree-shakeable, so this is already the minimum cost for those 4 functions + ES locale.
- **`root-JC5yJIQD.js` — 31 KB raw / 11 KB gzip.** root.tsx + IntlProvider + react-intl runtime + @formatjs internals.
- **`react-vertical-timeline-component`** is in its own lazy chunk (`index-CZhEOpFy.js`, 8 KB) and only loads when `/skills` is visited. Not a bottleneck.
- Per-route chunks (0.6–5 KB each) are appropriately tiny.

**Conclusion: JS payload is not the perf bottleneck.** T5's 0.87 LCP on `/skills` is more likely CSS-side (route stylesheet bundling, font critical path) or server-response latency. Bundle audit findings reduced the T5 search space significantly.

### T7 — Move visual-baseline regen to CI workflow (P1)

The `useLocation()` hydration race only reproduces in local Docker regen — not on CI runners. A "regen baselines" GitHub Action triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) would run the regen inside the actual CI environment, eliminate the race, and let us re-include `/education` index (T11 → also `/skills` routes).

### T8 — Remove `legacy-peer-deps=true` (P1)

Set because of `@types/react@19` vs `react@18` mismatch. Either upgrade React to 19 (Remix v2 supports it) or pin types to 18. Removes a long-running install warning.

### T9 — React Router v7 migration (P2)

Remix v2 is in maintenance mode; RRv7 is the official upgrade path. Resolves T15 (formerly TECH-DEBT #2 — react-router-dom pin). Route file conventions change. Large effort, but eventual.

### T10 — postcss-simple-vars → CSS custom properties (P2) — DONE

Migrated in two PRs (T10a + T10b). End state: every non-breakpoint token in the system lives as a CSS custom property declared in [app/styles/style.css](app/styles/style.css)'s `:root` block. Only the 5 breakpoint tokens (`$bp-sm` through `$bp-2xl`) remain on postcss-simple-vars, because `var()` is invalid inside `@media` preludes (CSS spec — see Bundle 1 investigation). [app/styles/constants.js](app/styles/constants.js) shrank from ~150 lines (with palette, legacy aliases, spacing/typography/borders/weights/shadows) to ~40 lines (breakpoints + their doc comment).

- **T10a — DONE.** Migrated the color palette and semantic theme tokens (`--bg-*`, `--fg-*`, `--accent*`, `--border-default`, `--border-emphasis`). The 26 in-file `$gray-*`/`$green-*`/`$surface-*`/`$border-card-*` simple-vars references were replaced with raw hex values; 12 legacy color aliases (`$default-white`, `$success-green`, `$text-color`, etc.) were audit-confirmed unused and deleted. Consumption sites already used `var(--accent)` etc., so component CSS didn't need changes.
- **T10b — DONE.** Swept the remaining numeric scale tokens (`--space-*`, `--font-*`, `--border-N`, `--weight-*`) across 16 stylesheets in one mechanical pass. Dropped 4 unused tokens (`$space-24`, `$space-48`, `$space-60`, `$shadow-1`) during the sweep. Re-enabled the three stylelint rules that were disabled while simple-vars confused the parser (`declaration-property-value-no-unknown`, `shorthand-property-no-redundant-values`, `color-function-alias-notation`); the third surfaced 7 `rgba()` callsites which auto-fixed to modern `rgb(... / α)`. Added two typo-catchers to replace the simple-vars `unknown` callback: `custom-property-no-missing-var-function` (catches `--token: --otherToken` written without `var()`) and `custom-property-pattern` enforcing kebab-case.

### T11 — Switch to Percy/Chromatic for `/skills` visual gate (P2) — DONE (dissolved)

The original premise was that three routes were excluded for two reasons and a paid tool might fix both. The Bundle 2 investigation separated the two reasons:

1. **`/skills/:uuid` + `/education` index** were out because of a local-Docker `useLocation()` hydration race — not a tool problem, an environment problem. **T7's CI-side regen workflow already runs Playwright in the actual CI container where the race doesn't fire** (proven on T16 and T10b PRs). Both routes are gated again as of this PR. Baselines captured via `gh workflow run regen-baselines.yml`.
2. **`/skills` index** is excluded for a different reason: the tenure-heatmap renders ~30 SVG cells × ~10 years on a tight grid, and sub-pixel anti-aliasing drifts ~0.4% across environments. **Percy / Chromatic pixel-diff SVG the same way** — they wouldn't escape this. The only "fixes" are masking the chart (defeats the gate) or raising the diff budget to ~0.5% (gate becomes useless for content shifts).

So T11 dissolves: no tool switch needed, the visual gate now covers `/`, `/education`, `/education/:slug`, and `/skills/1` (a stable detail page), with `/skills` index documented out for a permanent reason rather than a fixable one. See [tests/e2e/README.md](tests/e2e/README.md#why-skills-index-isnt-gated) for the updated rationale.

### T12 — Cloudflare KV / D1 / R2 bindings (P3) — DONE

Landed with Bundle 3 (U6 `/contact` route). [wrangler.jsonc](wrangler.jsonc) now declares the `RATELIMIT_KV` binding + `CONTACT_FROM` / `CONTACT_TO` vars; [worker-configuration.d.ts](worker-configuration.d.ts) is regenerated via `npm run cf-typegen`, and the contact action reads them via `context.cloudflare.env.*`. Additional bindings (D1, R2, Durable Objects) can slot in the same file when a consumer lands.

### T13 — Drop unused `@chromatic-com/storybook` (P3)

Visual regression is covered by Playwright. Storybook addon is installed but unused.

### T14 — Replace husky with simple-git-hooks (P3) — DONE

Replaced husky with `simple-git-hooks`. The pre-push script now lives at [scripts/pre-push.sh](scripts/pre-push.sh) (was [.husky/pre-push](.husky/pre-push)) and gets wired in via a new `simple-git-hooks` block in `package.json` plus a `prepare` script that invokes the binary. Migrating an existing clone requires `git config --unset core.hooksPath` once (husky set it to `.husky/_`); fresh clones don't need that step.

### T15 — `import/no-relative-parent-imports` ESLint rule (P3) — DONE

Implemented as a `no-restricted-imports` rule (the upstream `import/no-relative-parent-imports` rule resolves aliased paths to absolute paths, which false-positives on every `~/`-prefixed import in `app/`). The rule bans literal `../*` import specifiers and points authors at `~/*` (for `app/`) or the new `~data/*` alias (for `public/data/`). Added `~data/*` to both `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` so route loaders that read static JSON can use it. One escape hatch at `functions/[[path]].ts` (the Pages Function entrypoint legitimately imports the build output at `../build/server`).

### T16 — Standardise breakpoints (legacy → Tailwind-aligned scale) (P1) — DONE

All 17 legacy callsites swept to the Tailwind-aligned scale: `$mobile-small` (496) → `$bp-sm` (640); `$desktop-small` (1076) → `$bp-lg` (1024); `$desktop-medium` (1296) → `$bp-xl` (1280). Added `$bp-2xl: 1536px` for future ultrawide work. Deleted the three legacy keys from [constants.js](app/styles/constants.js). Also caught a hardcoded `(min-width: 1076px)` in [TenureHeatmap/index.tsx](app/components/TenureHeatmap/index.tsx) that mirrored the CSS breakpoint and updated it to `1024px` so JS and CSS gate at the same width.

**Original plan + current state for reference:**

[app/styles/constants.js](app/styles/constants.js) exports two parallel sets of breakpoint tokens:

| Token             | Value  | Usages | Origin                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$mobile-small`   | 496px  | 4      | Legacy — pre-Tailwind. Awkward; mid-phone-landscape band. |
| `$desktop-small`  | 1076px | 10     | Legacy — splits iPad Pro 11" landscape (1194) awkwardly.  |
| `$desktop-medium` | 1296px | 2      | Legacy — Tailwind `xl` (1280) + 16px noise.               |
| `$bp-sm`          | 640px  | —      | Tailwind-aligned. Currently unused in code.               |
| `$bp-md`          | 768px  | ~6     | iPad portrait, in use.                                    |
| `$bp-lg`          | 1024px | ~6     | iPad landscape / small laptops, in use.                   |
| `$bp-xl`          | 1280px | —      | Standard desktop. Currently unused.                       |

17 legacy usages across 10 stylesheets (4 routes + 4 components + 1 route shell + 1 helper) plus 12 new-token usages. The mixed scale makes it impossible to reason about a layout's break behaviour without opening the constants file.

**Goal.** Single mobile-first scale anchored to common device viewport widths, aligned with Tailwind v4 (also matches Bootstrap 5 and Material). Drop the three legacy tokens; add `$bp-2xl` for ultrawide content-max-width work.

**Target scale (`@media (min-width: $bp-*)`)**:

| Token     | Value  | Devices this catches                                          |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(base)_  | < 640  | Every phone in portrait (320 SE → 430 Pro Max).               |
| `$bp-sm`  | 640px  | Phone landscape (~700-900 wide). Compact tablets.             |
| `$bp-md`  | 768px  | iPad portrait (744-834). Z Fold inner. Large phone landscape. |
| `$bp-lg`  | 1024px | iPad landscape (1024-1194). Small laptops.                    |
| `$bp-xl`  | 1280px | iPad Pro 12.9" landscape. Standard 13-15" laptops.            |
| `$bp-2xl` | 1536px | 27" external monitors. Cap content max-width above this.      |

Standardising on the Tailwind scale means future contributors (or AI agents) can map directly between Tailwind utility prefixes and our token names without translation.

**Migration plan (one PR, ~30 min):**

1. Add `$bp-2xl: 1536px` to [app/styles/constants.js](app/styles/constants.js).
2. Sweep all 17 legacy usages and remap:
   - `$mobile-small` (496) → `$bp-sm` (640). Affected: [Input](app/components/Input/style.css), [Timeline](app/components/Timeline/style.css), [skills.$uuid](app/routes/skills.$uuid/style.css), [skills.\_index](app/routes/skills._index/style.css). The +144px floor is intentional — modern phones in portrait now go up to 430px wide, so the legacy 496 fires mid-landscape on most flagships. Re-test each affected layout at 412-640 to confirm the new floor is comfortable.
   - `$desktop-small` (1076) → `$bp-lg` (1024). Affected: [Card](app/components/Card/style.css), [Input](app/components/Input/style.css), [TenureHeatmap](app/components/TenureHeatmap/style.css), [Timeline](app/components/Timeline/style.css), all four routes that use it. The -52px lift is small enough that most layouts should hold; the TenureHeatmap explicitly tuned for 1076 (see [TenureHeatmap/style.css#L139](app/components/TenureHeatmap/style.css#L139)) — verify the transposed grid still fits at 1024.
   - `$desktop-medium` (1296) → `$bp-xl` (1280). Affected: [Timeline](app/components/Timeline/style.css), [skills.\_index](app/routes/skills._index/style.css). The -16px shift is below visual noise.
3. Delete `mobile-small`, `desktop-small`, `desktop-medium` keys from [constants.js](app/styles/constants.js).
4. Regenerate visual baselines via the CI workflow ([.github/workflows/regen-baselines.yml](.github/workflows/regen-baselines.yml)) — every gated route (`/`, `/education/:slug`) likely shifts at the 768/1024/1280 boundaries.
5. Update [AGENTS.md §6](AGENTS.md#L6) and the doc comment in [constants.js](app/styles/constants.js#L122) to reflect the single scale.

**Out of scope.**

- **Sub-640 breakpoint** (e.g. 414 / 480 for large-phone-landscape). web.dev's mobile-first guidance is to let content dictate rather than chase devices; base styles should already cover this band cleanly. Revisit only if a real layout regression appears.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` / `prefers-color-scheme` queries** — orthogonal to this work; tracked separately (U24).
- **Container queries** (`@container`). Worth piloting on a single component (e.g. Card) once we're off the legacy scale, but not a prereq for this migration.

**Devices on the bubble worth manually testing after migration:** iPhone SE 1st gen (320), Galaxy S24 (360), iPad mini portrait (744), iPad Pro 11" landscape (1194), 13" MacBook external (~1440). Chrome DevTools Responsive mode + the Pixel 7 Playwright project cover most of this.

## 2. Cleanup / data / docs

### C1 — Doc drift: README locale claims (P0)

[README.md:3](README.md#L3) and lines 67-68 + 117 still describe i18n as Accept-Language-only with the switcher "on the backlog." LocaleToggle shipped in PR #190, cookie-based cross-page persistence in PR #193. Rewrite to reflect the actual priority chain (`?lang=` → cookie → header) and the visible NavBar toggle.

### C2 — Doc drift: README "Future Plans" (P0)

[README.md:111-118](README.md#L111) lists Python/Django backend + contact form. If neither is happening, delete the section. If the contact form is still on the table, move it to U6 and delete the rest.

### C3 — Doc drift: AGENTS.md cross-refs to README plans (P0)

[AGENTS.md:13](AGENTS.md#L13) references the stale README claims. Sync once C2 lands.

### C4 — Data: `Mentoring` ranges (P1)

Currently `[{ jobId: 3 }]` (Professor only). Description text shows mentoring at Endava (id 4, "organized and mentored the Endava Argentina Internship program") and Qubika (id 6, EXTRA_ACTIVITIES has "Senior Internship" + "Frontend Mentor"). Add those ranges.

### C5 — Data: `Leadership` ranges (P1)

Currently `[{ jobId: 4 }]` (Endava only). Qubika (id 6) senior-track work likely includes leadership moments. User to confirm.

### C6 — Rename ambiguous `Programming` meta skill (P2) — DONE

Renamed to "Teaching Programming" (`Enseñanza de Programación`) in [public/data/skills.json](public/data/skills.json). The meta-skill is tagged on Professor + Teacher roles; the verb-first form reads naturally next to the existing "Teaching" chip and disambiguates from the literal act of writing code.

### C7 — Merge `getSkillsForJob` into `getSkillGroupsForJob` (P2) — DONE

Dropped `getSkillsForJob` from [app/utils/utils.tsx](app/utils/utils.tsx); its single consumer (`/skills` index timeline cards) now calls `getSkillGroupsForJob(SKILLS, item.id, locale).flatMap((g) => g.items)`. Side effects: timeline-card chips are now (a) locale-aware (previously always English for meta skills) and (b) deterministically ordered (`language → framework → tooling → infra → meta`, alphabetical within each) instead of SKILLS-array order. Test suite trimmed accordingly.

### C8 — Move `mergeRouteMeta` out of `utils.tsx` (P3) — DONE

Extracted `mergeRouteMeta`, `RouteMetaOverrides`, and the `SITE_URL` constant into [app/utils/meta.ts](app/utils/meta.ts). All 6 route consumers updated to import from `~/utils/meta`. `utils.tsx` now sits at ~340 lines, focused on layout/data helpers; the meta-tag concern lives in its own module.

### C9 — Move `FORWARD_GROUPS` out of TechTree component (P3) — DONE

Moved `FORWARD_GROUPS` + the `ForwardGroup` type into [app/components/TechTree/forward-groups.ts](app/components/TechTree/forward-groups.ts). The component now just imports the constant. Kept the data co-located with the component rather than promoting it to `skills.json` — these are aspirations (no SKILLS entry, no range), not job experiences, so the data shape doesn't match the skill-first schema.

### C10 — Validate `name_es` typos against a locale registry (P3) — DONE

`SKILL_NAME_ES_REGISTRY` in [app/data/skills-schema.ts](app/data/skills-schema.ts) is now the canonical map of English → Spanish skill names. The Zod `superRefine` on the skills payload checks each `SKILLS[].name_es` against the registry and throws a path-precise error on mismatch or on a `name_es` set for a skill with no registry entry. Committed with the tests in [app/data/skills-schema.test.ts](app/data/skills-schema.test.ts), including one that re-parses `public/data/skills.json` so a real drift between the file and the registry fails CI, not prod.

### C11 — Verify `npm run build:og` still works (P3) — DONE

Ran `npm run build:og` on `main` after the per-route OG PR landed. All four PNGs (`og-home.png`, `og-education.png`, `og-projects.png`, `og-skills.png`) re-rendered deterministically with no byte drift against the committed copies. The script reads `scripts/og/<slug>.svg`, swaps in the title/tagline at template time, and writes to `public/assets/img/og-<slug>.png` via `@resvg/resvg-js`. Repeatable + idempotent.

### C12 — Audit `app/assets/icons/` for orphans (P3) — DONE

Audited the 8 source SVGs against the codebase. All map to a real consumer: `Briefcase` (NavBar + Timeline), `Education` (NavBar + Timeline + both education routes), `GithubIcon`, `Home`, `LinkedinIcon`, `Paper` (all NavBar), `Sun` + `Moon` (ThemeToggle). No orphans to remove.

### C13 — README refresh + visual-baseline how-to (P1) — DONE

[README.md](README.md) has drifted across the last ~20 PRs. Concrete stale or missing items:

- **Stale claims to fix:**
  - "husky" pre-push hook → migrated to simple-git-hooks in T14.
  - `npm run build:og` writes `og.png` → now writes 4 per-route PNGs (`og-home`, `og-skills`, `og-education`, `og-projects`) via U8.
  - "Visual baselines for `/`, `/education`, `/education/:slug`" — `/education` index was excluded; current list is `/` + `/education/:slug`.
  - "Design tokens via simple-vars / unknown callback" — migrated to CSS custom properties in T10a/T10b with stylelint typo-catchers (`custom-property-no-missing-var-function`, `custom-property-pattern`).
  - Roadmap line about React Router / Next migration → currently tracked as T9 (React Router v7), Next.js no longer on the table.
- **Features shipped without README coverage:**
  - Lighthouse CI gating (T2) + the `lighthouse/` per-commit summary commit-back flow.
  - a11y testing via `@axe-core/playwright` (T1).
  - `/data/*` no longer publicly served — JSON only reaches the client via the rendered route (T3).
  - Per-route OG images (U8): `scripts/og/<slug>.svg` templates rendered by `npm run build:og`.
  - `/projects` index + `/projects/:slug` case studies (U7).
  - Print stylesheet for the CV pages (U2).
  - ESLint `~/`-alias enforcement + `~data/*` alias for `public/data` JSON imports (T15).
  - Standardised `.route-page-title` utility (recent doc PR).
  - Bundle 1 style-system overhaul: Tailwind-aligned breakpoint scale (T16), CSS custom properties migration (T10a + T10b).
- **Missing how-to sections:**
  - **Visual baselines** — two paths, both worth documenting in README rather than scattered across `tests/e2e/README.md` and AGENTS.md:
    - Local Docker: `npm run test:visual:update` (requires Docker Desktop, slower on Apple Silicon under amd64 emulation).
    - CI workflow: `gh workflow run regen-baselines.yml --ref <branch>` or the Actions UI dispatch. Runs in the exact CI environment so output is pixel-perfect; commits new PNGs back to the dispatched branch automatically.
  - **Updating content** — pointer to `public/data/skills.json` + `public/data/education.json` + the localisation pattern (`_es` siblings, `localized()` helper).
  - **Adding a locale** — pointer to `app/intl/index.ts`'s `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` list + `LocaleToggle` `--knob-index` math, with a 3-step recipe.

Bundled into Bundle 2 (`/skills` quality) because the perf investigation phase touches the lighthouse story anyway and the prose changes pair naturally with that.

## 3. UI / features

### U1 — Real Home hero (P0)

Current home is a welcome paragraph + repo link + CV download. Both audiences (recruiters, tech leads) land here. Add a one-line value prop, 3-5 top metrics (years, roles), a "Currently at Qubika" badge, and 3 link-CTAs. Same shape as tomdale.net, kentcdodds.com.

### U2 — Print stylesheet (P0)

Recruiters Ctrl-P CV pages surprisingly often. Current dark theme + sidebar nav makes the print preview unusable. `@media print { ... }` block, ~50 lines.

### U3 — Promote in-progress Bachelor's on `/education` (P0)

Bachelor's (in progress) and Associate Degree (completed) render at the same visual weight. Add a "Currently studying" badge or top-row treatment to the active degree.

### U4 — Locale-aware date format on `/education` (P0)

Index route still uses `01/2024 - 09/2027` numeric format. `/education/:slug` was upgraded to "March 2024 → September 2027" with the recent PR. Match the index format for consistency.

### U5 — Match contrast fix on DownloadBtn hover state (P0)

[app/components/DownloadBtn/style.css:26](app/components/DownloadBtn/style.css#L26) — hover sets `color: #ffffff` on `background: var(--accent)` (#0fbf3e green). Same ~2.4:1 contrast issue as the LocaleToggle finding (already fixed). Lighthouse hasn't flagged this one yet but the math is identical. Swap to `var(--bg-base)` or `$gray-6`.

### U6 — `/contact` route (P1)

Cloudflare Pages Function POSTing to Resend or Loops. Rate-limited via Cloudflare KV. Demonstrates CF Workers chops in an interview. Drop the "future contact form" promise from README (C2).

### U7 — Case studies — `/projects/<slug>` (P1)

3-5 abstracted write-ups of representative work (e.g. "AI-powered finance docs platform" from your Adalabs work at Qubika). Each: Problem / Constraints / Approach / Outcome, 300-500 words. No client names, no code samples. Solves the "no public repos" gap — depth signal lives in the writing.

### U8 — Per-route OG images (P1)

OG image is generated from SVG today (`scripts/render-og-image.mjs`). Add per-route variants: `/skills` shows heatmap snapshot, `/projects/<slug>` shows project hero. CF Workers OG generation is the idiomatic pattern.

### U9 — 404 page polish (P1)

Route-level ErrorBoundary on `/skills/:uuid` and `/education/:slug` looks good. The root error boundary (unknown URLs) doesn't match. Unify the design.

### U10–U24 — Parked (2026-07-01)

The four active bundles delivered the site's core proposition (skill-first
model, tenure heatmap, /skills detail pages, /education timeline, /projects
case studies, /contact form on CF Workers + Resend, per-route OG, print
stylesheet, a11y + Lighthouse gates, RR v7 + Workers migration). The
remaining UI ideas below are **parked**, not open. Two reasons:

1. **The app is at its content density limit.** The mobile NavBar is
   already at the edge of what fits without a hamburger drawer, and the
   `/skills` page carries the tenure heatmap + TechTree + timeline +
   autocomplete on one route. Adding tooltips (U12, U18), stat strips
   (U23), or a Cmd-K modal (U13) makes each surface heavier for
   diminishing recruiter signal.
2. **The items are demo-driven, not user-driven.** U14 (Durable Objects
   viewer count), U15 (edge A/B on the tagline), U21 (GitHub activity
   feed) are CF Workers show-off features that visitors don't need.
   They belong in a separate demo project if the interviewing signal is
   what's wanted.

**Individually parked:**

- **U10** (Spanish CV PDF): the site already falls back cleanly to the
  English PDF for `es` visitors via `getCvUrl` in [app/utils/utils.tsx](app/utils/utils.tsx#L18).
  Not worth producing a translated design for a low-traffic asset.
- **U11** (`/blog` or `/notes`): the README "AI Assistance" section
  captures the useful write-up already. A blog surface would need
  ongoing content.
- **U12, U13, U17, U18, U22, U23** (heatmap tooltips, Cmd-K, display
  typography, chip tooltips, extended filter chips, stat strip): pure
  polish; the base UX is already at 0.95+ Lighthouse across routes.
- **U14, U15, U21** (viewers badge, edge A/B, GitHub feed): interview
  demo material that adds surface without user value.
- **U16, U19** (second accent, hamburger/FAB): visual identity changes;
  the current GitHub-green + sidebar+bottom-nav pattern is stable.
- **U20** (endorsements): friction is asking managers, not the code.
- **U24** (`prefers-reduced-motion` sweep beyond LocaleToggle): only
  ThemeToggle + Timeline animate meaningfully; both are under 300 ms
  and unlikely to trip vestibular sensitivity.

If any of these gets revisited, restore the individual `### Un — ...`
section and flip the row in the Status table back to `open`.

## How to use this file

1. Pick an open item (start with P0s).
2. Mark **status** column → `in-progress`, create the PR.
3. When merged → `done` (and check off the entry in any open PR description that referenced it).
4. New items get appended to the right section and added to the Status table.

Status legend: `open` / `in-progress` / `done` / `parked` (deliberately
not pursuing; reason recorded above) / `dropped` (decided not to do).
